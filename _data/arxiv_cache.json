      "abstract": "Graphon models provide a flexible nonparametric framework for estimating\nlatent connectivity probabilities in networks, enabling a range of downstream\napplications such as link prediction and data augmentation. However, accurate\ngraphon estimation typically requires a large graph, whereas in practice, one\noften only observes a small-sized network. One approach to addressing this\nissue is to adopt a transfer learning framework, which aims to improve\nestimation in a small target graph by leveraging structural information from a\nlarger, related source graph. In this paper, we propose a novel method, namely\nGTRANS, a transfer learning framework that integrates neighborhood smoothing\nand Gromov-Wasserstein optimal transport to align and transfer structural\npatterns between graphs. To prevent negative transfer, GTRANS includes an\nadaptive debiasing mechanism that identifies and corrects for target-specific\ndeviations via residual smoothing. We provide theoretical guarantees on the\nstability of the estimated alignment matrix and demonstrate the effectiveness\nof GTRANS in improving the accuracy of target graph estimation through\nextensive synthetic and real data experiments. These improvements translate\ndirectly to enhanced performance in downstream applications, such as the graph\nclassification task and the link prediction task.",

      "abstract": "The Busemann function has recently found much interest in a variety of\ngeometric machine learning problems, as it naturally defines projections onto\ngeodesic rays of Riemannian manifolds and generalizes the notion of\nhyperplanes. As several sources of data can be conveniently modeled as\nprobability distributions, it is natural to study this function in the\nWasserstein space, which carries a rich formal Riemannian structure induced by\nOptimal Transport metrics. In this work, we investigate the existence and\ncomputation of Busemann functions in Wasserstein space, which admits geodesic\nrays. We establish closed-form expressions in two important cases:\none-dimensional distributions and Gaussian measures. These results enable\nexplicit projection schemes for probability distributions on $\\mathbb{R}$,\nwhich in turn allow us to define novel Sliced-Wasserstein distances over\nGaussian mixtures and labeled datasets. We demonstrate the efficiency of those\noriginal schemes on synthetic datasets as well as transfer learning problems.",

      "abstract": "Regularization is a central tool for addressing ill-posedness in inverse\nproblems and statistical estimation, with the choice of a suitable penalty\noften determining the reliability and interpretability of downstream solutions.\nWhile recent work has characterized optimal regularizers for well-specified\ndata distributions, practical deployments are often complicated by\ndistributional uncertainty and the need to enforce structural constraints such\nas convexity. In this paper, we introduce a framework for distributionally\nrobust optimal regularization, which identifies regularizers that remain\neffective under perturbations of the data distribution. Our approach leverages\nconvex duality to reformulate the underlying distributionally robust\noptimization problem, eliminating the inner maximization and yielding\nformulations that are amenable to numerical computation. We show how the\nresulting robust regularizers interpolate between memorization of the training\ndistribution and uniform priors, providing insights into their behavior as\nrobustness parameters vary. For example, we show how certain ambiguity sets,\nsuch as those based on the Wasserstein-1 distance, naturally induce regularity\nin the optimal regularizer by promoting regularizers with smaller Lipschitz\nconstants. We further investigate the setting where regularizers are required\nto be convex, formulating a convex program for their computation and\nillustrating their stability with respect to distributional shifts. Taken\ntogether, our results provide both theoretical and computational foundations\nfor designing regularizers that are reliable under model uncertainty and\nstructurally constrained for robust deployment.",

We prove that the existence of\na saddle point for this problem is equivalent to that for a finite-dimensional\nminimax problem, and give a counterexample demonstrating that the saddle point\nmay not exist. Motivated by this observation, we present a verifiable necessary\nand sufficient condition whose parameters can be derived from a convex problem\nand its dual. Additionally, we also introduce a simplified sufficient\ncondition, which intuitively indicates that when the Wasserstein radii are\nsmall enough, the saddle point always exists. In the absence of the saddle\npoint, we solve an finite-dimensional nonconvex minimax problem, obtained by\nrestricting the estimator to be linear. Its optimal value establishes an upper\nbound on the robust estimation problem, while its optimal solution yields a\nrobust linear estimator. Numerical experiments are also provided to validate\nour theoretical results.",

      "abstract": "Conditional risk minimization arises in high-stakes decisions where risk must\nbe assessed in light of side information, such as stressed economic conditions,\nspecific customer profiles, or other contextual covariates.

Yet these approaches remain\nfragmented, each constrained by its own limitations: some rely on point\nestimates or restrictive structural assumptions, others apply only to narrow\nclasses of risk measures, and their structural connections are unclear. We\nintroduce a universal framework for distributionally robust conditional risk\nminimization, built on a novel union-ball formulation in optimal transport.\nThis framework offers three key advantages: interpretability, by subsuming\nexisting methods as special cases and revealing their deep structural links;\ntractability, by yielding convex reformulations for virtually all major risk\nfunctionals studied in the literature; and scalability, by supporting\ncutting-plane algorithms for large-scale conditional risk problems.\nApplications to portfolio optimization with rank-dependent expected utility\nhighlight the practical effectiveness of the framework, with conditional models\nconverging to optimal solutions where unconditional ones clearly do not.",
