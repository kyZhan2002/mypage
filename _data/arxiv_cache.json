      "abstract": "Background: Spatial transcriptomics have emerged as a powerful tool in\nbiomedical research because of its ability to capture both the spatial contexts\nand abundance of the complete RNA transcript profile in organs of interest.\nHowever, limitations of the technology such as the relatively low resolution\nand comparatively insufficient sequencing depth make it difficult to reliably\nextract real biological signals from these data. To alleviate this challenge,\nwe propose a novel transfer learning framework, referred to as TransST, to\nadaptively leverage the cell-labeled information from external sources in\ninferring cell-level heterogeneity of a target spatial transcriptomics data.\n  Results: Applications in several real studies as well as a number of\nsimulation settings show that our approach significantly improves existing\ntechniques. For example, in the breast cancer study, TransST successfully\nidentifies five biologically meaningful cell clusters, including the two\nsubgroups of cancer in situ and invasive cancer; in addition, only TransST is\nable to separate the adipose tissues from the connective issues among all the\nstudied methods.\n  Conclusions: In summary, the proposed method TransST is both effective and\nrobust in identifying cell subclusters and detecting corresponding driving\nbiomarkers in spatial transcriptomics data.",

      "abstract": "Sepsis remains a critical challenge due to its high mortality and complex\nprognosis. To address data limitations in studying MSSA sepsis, we extend\nexisting transfer learning frameworks to accommodate transformation models for\nhigh-dimensional survival data. Specifically, we construct a measurement index\nbased on C-index for intelligently identifying the helpful source datasets, and\nthe target model performance is improved by leveraging information from the\nidentified source datasets via performing the transfer step and debiasing step.\nWe further provide an algorithm to construct confidence intervals for each\ncoefficient component. Another significant development is that statistical\nproperties are rigorously established, including $\\ell_1/\\ell_2$-estimation\nerror bounds of the transfer learning algorithm, detection consistency property\nof the transferable source detection algorithm and asymptotic theories for the\nconfidence interval construction. Extensive simulations and analysis of\nMIMIC-IV sepsis data demonstrate the estimation and prediction accuracy, and\npractical advantages of our approach, providing significant improvements in\nsurvival estimates for MSSA sepsis patients.",

      "abstract": "Reliable machine learning and statistical analysis rely on diverse,\nwell-distributed training data. However, real-world datasets are often limited\nin size and exhibit underrepresentation across key subpopulations, leading to\nbiased predictions and reduced performance, particularly in supervised tasks\nsuch as classification. To address these challenges, we propose Conditional\nData Synthesis Augmentation (CoDSA), a novel framework that leverages\ngenerative models, such as diffusion models, to synthesize high-fidelity data\nfor improving model performance across multimodal domains including tabular,\ntextual, and image data. CoDSA generates synthetic samples that faithfully\ncapture the conditional distributions of the original data, with a focus on\nunder-sampled or high-interest regions. Through transfer learning, CoDSA\nfine-tunes pre-trained generative models to enhance the realism of synthetic\ndata and increase sample density in sparse areas. This process preserves\ninter-modal relationships, mitigates data imbalance, improves domain\nadaptation, and boosts generalization. We also introduce a theoretical\nframework that quantifies the statistical accuracy improvements enabled by\nCoDSA as a function of synthetic sample volume and targeted region allocation,\nproviding formal guarantees of its effectiveness. Extensive experiments\ndemonstrate that CoDSA consistently outperforms non-adaptive augmentation\nstrategies and state-of-the-art baselines in both supervised and unsupervised\nsettings.",

      "abstract": "This paper explores transfer learning in heterogeneous multi-source\nenvironments with distributional divergence between target and auxiliary\ndomains. To address challenges in statistical bias and computational\nefficiency, we propose a Sparse Optimization for Transfer Learning (SOTL)\nframework based on L0-regularization. The method extends the Joint Estimation\nTransferred from Strata (JETS) paradigm with two key innovations: (1)\nL0-constrained exact sparsity for parameter space compression and complexity\nreduction, and (2) refining optimization focus to emphasize target parameters\nover redundant ones. Simulations show that SOTL significantly improves both\nestimation accuracy and computational speed, especially under adversarial\nauxiliary domain conditions. Empirical validation on the Community and Crime\nbenchmarks demonstrates the statistical robustness of the SOTL method in\ncross-domain transfer.",
