      "abstract": "Motivated by practical applications where stable long-term performance is\ncritical-such as robotics, operations research, and healthcare-we study the\nproblem of distributionally robust (DR) average-reward reinforcement learning.\nWe propose two algorithms that achieve near-optimal sample complexity. The\nfirst reduces the problem to a DR discounted Markov decision process (MDP),\nwhile the second, Anchored DR Average-Reward MDP, introduces an anchoring state\nto stabilize the controlled transition kernels within the uncertainty set.\nAssuming the nominal MDP is uniformly ergodic, we prove that both algorithms\nattain a sample complexity of $\\widetilde{O}\\left(|\\mathbf{S}||\\mathbf{A}|\nt_{\\mathrm{mix}}^2\\varepsilon^{-2}\\right)$ for estimating the optimal policy as\nwell as the robust average reward under KL and $f_k$-divergence-based\nuncertainty sets, provided the uncertainty radius is sufficiently small. Here,\n$\\varepsilon$ is the target accuracy, $|\\mathbf{S}|$ and $|\\mathbf{A}|$ denote\nthe sizes of the state and action spaces, and $t_{\\mathrm{mix}}$ is the mixing\ntime of the nominal MDP. This represents the first finite-sample convergence\nguarantee for DR average-reward reinforcement learning. We further validate the\nconvergence rates of our algorithms through numerical experiments.",

      "abstract": "We propose a new framework for multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL),\nwhere the agents cooperate in a time-evolving network with latent community\nstructures and mixed memberships. Unlike traditional neighbor-based or fixed\ninteraction graphs, our community-based framework captures flexible and\nabstract coordination patterns by allowing each agent to belong to multiple\noverlapping communities. Each community maintains shared policy and value\nfunctions, which are aggregated by individual agents according to personalized\nmembership weights. We also design actor-critic algorithms that exploit this\nstructure: agents inherit community-level estimates for policy updates and\nvalue learning, enabling structured information sharing without requiring\naccess to other agents' policies. Importantly, our approach supports both\ntransfer learning by adapting to new agents or tasks via membership estimation,\nand active learning by prioritizing uncertain communities during exploration.\nTheoretically, we establish convergence guarantees under linear function\napproximation for both actor and critic updates. To our knowledge, this is the\nfirst MARL framework that integrates community structure, transferability, and\nactive learning with provable guarantees.",

      "abstract": "Distributionally robust optimization has become a powerful tool for\nprediction and decision-making under model uncertainty. By focusing on the\nlocal worst-case risk, it enhances robustness by identifying the most\nunfavorable distribution within a predefined ambiguity set. While extensive\nresearch has been conducted in parametric settings, studies on nonparametric\nframeworks remain limited. This paper studies the generalization properties of\nWasserstein distributionally robust nonparametric estimators, with particular\nattention to the impact of model misspecification, where non-negligible\ndiscrepancies between the estimation function space and target function can\nimpair generalization performance. We establish non-asymptotic error bounds for\nthe excess local worst-case risk by analyzing the regularization effects\ninduced by distributional perturbations and employing feedforward neural\nnetworks with Lipschitz constraints. These bounds illustrate how uncertainty\nlevels and neural network structures influence generalization performance and\nare applicable to both Lipschitz and quadratic loss functions. Furthermore, we\ninvestigate the Lagrangian relaxation of the local worst-case risk and derive\ncorresponding non-asymptotic error bounds for these estimators. The robustness\nof the proposed estimator is evaluated through simulation studies and\nillustrated with an application to the MNIST dataset.",

Each component of the\nsolution corresponds to the discount curve implied by a specific product class.\nWe introduce an additional regularization term motivated by economic\nprinciples, promoting smoothness of spread curves between product classes, and\nshow that it leads to a valid separable kernel structure. A main theoretical\ncontribution is a decomposition of the vector-valued RKHS norm induced by\nseparable kernels. We further provide a Gaussian process interpretation of\nvector-valued KR, enabling quantification of estimation uncertainty.\nIllustrative examples demonstrate that transfer learning significantly improves\nextrapolation performance and tightens confidence intervals compared to\nsingle-curve estimation.",

Understanding clinical\nvariables such as FiO2, creatinine, platelets, and lactate, which reflect\noxygenation, kidney function, coagulation, and metabolism, is crucial because\nthese markers influence sepsis outcomes and may vary by sex.

These weights\nadjust for cohort differences, are proportional to each cohort's effective\nsample size, and downweight dissimilar cohorts. TRANSLATE offers theoretical\nguarantees for improved precision and applies to a wide range of estimands,\nincluding means, variances, and distribution functions.

Such general feature extraction\nfacilitates the discovery of transferable knowledge, mitigates systematic\nbiases such as batch effects, and promotes fairness. In this paper, we propose\nStable Principal Component Analysis (StablePCA), a novel method for group\ndistributionally robust learning of latent representations from\nhigh-dimensional multi-source data. A primary challenge in generalizing PCA to\nthe multi-source regime lies in the nonconvexity of the fixed rank constraint,\nrendering the minimax optimization nonconvex. To address this challenge, we\nemploy the Fantope relaxation, reformulating the problem as a convex minimax\noptimization, with the objective defined as the maximum loss across sources. To\nsolve the relaxed formulation, we devise an optimistic-gradient Mirror Prox\nalgorithm with explicit closed-form updates. Theoretically, we establish the\nglobal convergence of the Mirror Prox algorithm, with the convergence rate\nprovided from the optimization perspective. Furthermore, we offer practical\ncriteria to assess how closely the solution approximates the original nonconvex\nformulation.
