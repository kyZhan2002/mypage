      "abstract": "We propose a framework for transfer learning of discount curves across\ndifferent fixed-income product classes. Motivated by challenges in estimating\ndiscount curves from sparse or noisy data, we extend kernel ridge regression\n(KR) to a vector-valued setting, formulating a convex optimization problem in a\nvector-valued reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS). Each component of the\nsolution corresponds to the discount curve implied by a specific product class.\nWe introduce an additional regularization term motivated by economic\nprinciples, promoting smoothness of spread curves between product classes, and\nshow that it leads to a valid separable kernel structure. A main theoretical\ncontribution is a decomposition of the vector-valued RKHS norm induced by\nseparable kernels. We further provide a Gaussian process interpretation of\nvector-valued KR, enabling quantification of estimation uncertainty.\nIllustrative examples demonstrate that transfer learning significantly improves\nextrapolation performance and tightens confidence intervals compared to\nsingle-curve estimation.",

      "abstract": "Lung sepsis remains a significant concern in the Northeastern U.S., yet the\nnational eICU Collaborative Database includes only a small number of patients\nfrom this region, highlighting underrepresentation. Understanding clinical\nvariables such as FiO2, creatinine, platelets, and lactate, which reflect\noxygenation, kidney function, coagulation, and metabolism, is crucial because\nthese markers influence sepsis outcomes and may vary by sex. Transfer learning\nhelps address small sample sizes by borrowing information from larger datasets,\nalthough differences in covariates and outcome-generating mechanisms between\nthe target and external cohorts can complicate the process. We propose a novel\nweighting method, TRANSfer LeArning wiTh wEights (TRANSLATE), to integrate data\nfrom various sources by incorporating domain-specific characteristics through\nlearned weights that align external data with the target cohort. These weights\nadjust for cohort differences, are proportional to each cohort's effective\nsample size, and downweight dissimilar cohorts. TRANSLATE offers theoretical\nguarantees for improved precision and applies to a wide range of estimands,\nincluding means, variances, and distribution functions. Simulations and a\nreal-data application to sepsis outcomes in the Northeast cohort, using a much\nlarger sample from other U.S. regions, show that the method enhances inference\nwhile accounting for regional heterogeneity.",

To further guard\nagainst finite, noisy data, model-based approaches admit Bayesian formulations\nthat propagate uncertainty from the posterior to the decision-making problem.\nHowever, when the model is misspecified, the decision maker must stretch the\nambiguity set to contain the data-generating process (DGP), leading to overly\nconservative decisions. We address this challenge by introducing DRO with\nRobust, to model misspecification, Bayesian Ambiguity Sets (DRO-RoBAS).

We show that\nthe resulting optimisation problem obtains a dual formulation in the\nReproducing Kernel Hilbert Space and we give probabilistic guarantees on the\ntolerance level of the ambiguity set.

      "abstract": "When synthesizing multisource high-dimensional data, a key objective is to\nextract low-dimensional feature representations that effectively approximate\nthe original features across different sources. Such general feature extraction\nfacilitates the discovery of transferable knowledge, mitigates systematic\nbiases such as batch effects, and promotes fairness. In this paper, we propose\nStable Principal Component Analysis (StablePCA), a novel method for group\ndistributionally robust learning of latent representations from\nhigh-dimensional multi-source data. A primary challenge in generalizing PCA to\nthe multi-source regime lies in the nonconvexity of the fixed rank constraint,\nrendering the minimax optimization nonconvex. To address this challenge, we\nemploy the Fantope relaxation, reformulating the problem as a convex minimax\noptimization, with the objective defined as the maximum loss across sources. To\nsolve the relaxed formulation, we devise an optimistic-gradient Mirror Prox\nalgorithm with explicit closed-form updates. Theoretically, we establish the\nglobal convergence of the Mirror Prox algorithm, with the convergence rate\nprovided from the optimization perspective. Furthermore, we offer practical\ncriteria to assess how closely the solution approximates the original nonconvex\nformulation. Through extensive numerical experiments, we demonstrate\nStablePCA's high accuracy and efficiency in extracting robust low-dimensional\nrepresentations across various finite-sample scenarios.",

Leveraging\nBayesian Ordinal Classification (BOC) and calibrated uncertainty thresholds,\nthe method enables confident QA predictions without relying on ground truth\ncontours or extensive manual labeling. Methods: We developed a BOC model to\nclassify auto-contour quality and quantify prediction uncertainty. A\ncalibration step was used to optimize uncertainty thresholds that meet clinical\naccuracy needs. The method was validated under three data scenarios: no manual\nlabels, limited labels, and extensive labels. For rectum contours in prostate\ncancer, we applied geometric surrogate labels when manual labels were absent,\ntransfer learning when limited, and direct supervision when ample labels were\navailable. Results: The BOC model delivered robust performance across all\nscenarios. Fine-tuning with just 30 manual labels and calibrating with 34\nsubjects yielded over 90% accuracy on test data. Using the calibrated\nthreshold, over 93% of the auto-contours' qualities were accurately predicted\nin over 98% of cases, reducing unnecessary manual reviews and highlighting\ncases needing correction. Conclusion: The proposed QA model enhances contouring\nefficiency in OART by reducing manual workload and enabling fast, informed\nclinical decisions. Through uncertainty quantification, it ensures safer, more\nreliable radiotherapy workflows.",

This makes analysis of this bias\nparticularly important. In this paper, we provide higher order properties of\nthe bias. In contrast to the existing literature related to this problem, we do\nnot assume that the support of the target distribution of the covariates is\nstrictly included in that of the source, and we analyse two geometric\nconditions on the support that avoid such boundary bias problems. We show that\nthese conditions are much more general than the usual convex support\nassumption, leading to an improvement of existing results.
