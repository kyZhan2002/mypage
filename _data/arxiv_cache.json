      "abstract": "There is growing interest in extending average treatment effect (ATE)\nestimation to incorporate non-tabular data, such as images and text, which may\nact as sources of confounding. Neglecting these effects risks biased results\nand flawed scientific conclusions. However, incorporating non-tabular data\nnecessitates sophisticated feature extractors, often in combination with ideas\nof transfer learning. In this work, we investigate how latent features from\npre-trained neural networks can be leveraged to adjust for sources of\nconfounding. We formalize conditions under which these latent features enable\nvalid adjustment and statistical inference in ATE estimation, demonstrating\nresults along the example of double machine learning. We discuss critical\nchallenges inherent to latent feature learning and downstream parameter\nestimation arising from the high dimensionality and non-identifiability of\nrepresentations. Common structural assumptions for obtaining fast convergence\nrates with additive or sparse linear models are shown to be unrealistic for\nlatent features. We argue, however, that neural networks are largely\ninsensitive to these issues. In particular, we show that neural networks can\nachieve fast convergence rates by adapting to intrinsic notions of sparsity and\ndimension of the learning problem.",

      "abstract": "Link prediction in multilayer networks is a key challenge in applications\nsuch as recommendation systems and protein-protein interaction prediction.\nWhile many techniques have been developed, most rely on assumptions about\nshared structures and require access to raw auxiliary data, limiting their\npracticality. To address these issues, we propose a novel transfer learning\nframework for multilayer networks using a bi-level model averaging method. A\n$K$-fold cross-validation criterion based on edges is used to automatically\nweight inter-layer and intra-layer candidate models. This enables the transfer\nof information from auxiliary layers while mitigating model uncertainty, even\nwithout prior knowledge of shared structures. Theoretically, we prove the\noptimality and weight convergence of our method under mild conditions.\nComputationally, our framework is efficient and privacy-preserving, as it\navoids raw data sharing and supports parallel processing across multiple\nservers. Simulations show our method outperforms others in predictive accuracy\nand robustness. We further demonstrate its practical value through two\nreal-world recommendation system applications.",

      "abstract": "In this paper, we develop a novel transfer learning methodology to tackle the\nchallenge of data scarcity in functional linear models. The methodology\nincorporates samples from the target model (target domain) alongside those from\nauxiliary models (source domains), transferring knowledge of coefficient shape\nfrom the source domains to the target domain. This shape-based knowledge\ntransfer offers two key advantages. First, it is robust to covariate scaling,\nensuring effectiveness despite variations in data distributions across\ndifferent source domains. Second, the notion of coefficient shape homogeneity\nrepresents a meaningful advance beyond traditional coefficient homogeneity,\nallowing the method to exploit a wider range of source domains and achieve\nsignificantly improved model estimation. We rigorously analyze the convergence\nrates of the proposed estimator and examine the minimax optimality. Our\nfindings show that the degree of improvement depends not only on the similarity\nof coefficient shapes between the target and source domains, but also on\ncoefficient magnitudes and the spectral decay rates of the functional\ncovariates covariance operators. To address situations where only a subset of\nauxiliary models is informative for the target model, we further develop a\ndata-driven procedure for identifying such informative sources. The\neffectiveness of the proposed methodology is demonstrated through comprehensive\nsimulation studies and an application to occupation time analysis using\nphysical activity data from the U.S. National Health and Nutrition Examination\nSurvey.",
